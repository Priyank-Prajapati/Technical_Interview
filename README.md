With your trusty sword, you must fight your way through the hostile environment, defeating enemies that stand in your path. Your mission is to cleanse the graveyard of the undead and reclaim your honor as the knight of the realm.

Additional Features

Known Issues and Bugs

* Platform Interactions: There might be minor issues when the player is on moving platforms, occasionally causing slight movement delays or desync.
* NavMesh: Enemies sometimes have trouble navigating borders, leading them to stop moving momentarily.

Level Design

Suggestions for Further Improvement

* Health and Power-ups: Implementing health packs or power-ups scattered throughout the level can make the game more engaging and challenging.
